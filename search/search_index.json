To make it easier for you we've put together a simple guide for this, think of it as a nifty hand-book for Mila. Inviting Mila Inviting Mila is pretty simple, all you have to do is: Make sure you have manage server/owner perms on your server Click here to go to the invite page Click authorize Because Mila is such a powerful bot, she needs a lot of permissions, feel free to replace administrator with everything else but she must have some permission to execute mod actions. Below is an image to demonstrate this! Server Setup Mila's configuration options can be pretty advanced and a bit overwhelming at times, to take some weight off of your back, Mila has a setup command that will run you through a process where you can setup a basic configuration. Tip Some settings accept skip as an option to allow you to leave a certain setting unchanged. Running Setup Triggering server setup is pretty simple. Once Mila has joined your server, be sure to run the m.setup command and follow through everything, this will let you set some basic options without having to read Mila's advanced configuration guide . Custom Prefix If you answered yes to Mila's first question, Mila will ask you if you'd like to set a custom prefix for the server. If you do, then simply say the prefix, if not then simply say skip to skip the step. Welcome Message Once you've done that Mila will ask you to set a welcome message. This is the message displayed on the user log sent when a member joins! Goodbye Message Next, Mila will ask you for a goodbye message, this is the same as a greeting message, except it is shown when a user leaves. Logging Channel After that, Mila will ask you to mention or provide the ID of the channel that you want to use as your logging channels. This is where all of Mila's logs will be sent, these can be set individually with advanced commands. Logging Messages Once you've answered that, Mila will ask you if you wish to log message edits and deletes in the logging channel, react accordingly to your desired setting. Member Role Finally, Mila will ask you to provide a member role, this is what is assigned to a member when they join. Think of it as an automatic role that is assigned to everyone that joins. Info If Mila is missing the Manage Roles permission then you will not be asked this question. All Done Once you've finished the final step, you are done! You've successfully setup a basic configuration that has already given you a taster of Mila's true ability. Additional Support In case you need any extra help or support, you can always join Mila's Discord server and the team will do their best to help you out!","title":"Setup"},{"location":"#setup-documentation","text":"","title":"Setup Documentation"},{"location":"#setup","text":"To some, setting up Mila can prove challenging if you're not sure what you're doing.

Luckily, we've cooked up a way for you to blacklist a certain channel to make Mila ignore it. Tip All blacklists are case-insensitive Disable Commands Mila has an option to disable commands for non-mod users in a specified channel. This process is very simple to do, all you have to do is add <Mila:NoCmd> somewhere in the channels topic, undoing this is as simple as removing it. Disable Starboard Every now and then you don't want people to be able to add stars to messages in a channel because then it'd go onto the Starboard. Luckily, Mila has a way for you to do this, simply add <Mila:NoStar> to the channel's topic to disable starboard usage within that channel! Disable Message Logging Sometimes, when Mila has Administrator permissions, she will record any message deletes/edits sent in channels such as the channel for Administrators. The problem is, that means your Moderator team or sometimes even your entire server can read some of those messages. To fix this, all you have to do is add <Mila:NoMsg> to the topic of that channel that you want Mila to ignore. Disable Auto Mod Disabling Auto Mod for a specific channel is as simple as adding <Mila:NoMod> to the channels topic. Note that anti-hoist will not be affected, this is because anti-hoist is based on the server, not a channel. Disable Anti Invite Occasionally, often for self-promotion channels, you want to allow users to send Discord links but still disallow porn links & message spam. To do this, simply add <Mila:AlwInv> to the channel's topic. Disable Anti Porn Adding <Mila:AlwPorn> to a channel's topic will allow people to send pornographic links in a certain channel, by default, Mila already ignores NSFW channels, but just in case, we added this. Disable Anti Spam While highly uncommon, on a very rare occasion you have channel that you are fine for people to spam in.

The developers often times find themselves fixing a bug that they found by messing around with the commands. However, sometimes, users receive an Unknown Error stating some garbled message that looks like only a programmer could understand it, that's where the bug command comes in. Bug Hunting Some users choose to help developers by searching for bugs in a bot just to burn time. You don't have to do this, but just using the bot as you normally would occasionally rewards you with a bug. Once you've found a bug, be it a typo or programmatical error, you can report it via the m.bug command. Note Programmatical errors are automatically reported to the developers along with a Traceback that tells the developers how and where the error happened so that the issue can be quickly fixed. However, you can still report the bug if you wish. Distinguishing Bugs & Errors Bug A programmatical bug can only be found when Mila sends an Unknown Error, if this is not the type of error message sent by Mila then it is not a bug, but is rather a simple end-user mistake. Error An error is the term we use to distinguish a bug from an end-user mistake. These tend to be Input Errors or Missing Authorization errors. Reporting Bugs Reporting a bug is as simple as using m.bug <your bug> , this will create a bug report that is sent to the developers where we investigate your issue.

When a user joins a server configured with this system, they are required to fulfil a newly-generated captcha in order to gain a role in which gives them access to the server. This is useful because it prevents user-bots from joining your server and causing mayhem. There are a few simple setup steps required before the Captcha Verification system can be used. These steps are documented below for ease of use. Enabling Captcha Verification To enable the Captcha Verification, use m.config -captcha and click on the green emoji. Captcha Logging If you want to, you can receive logs on everything that happens in your server in terms of captchas. To set this channel, do m.config -captcha -log <#channel> . This setting is optional. Rules Channel Every public server should have a channel containing their server rules. Likewise, Mila requires that this channel be configured so that she can remind new users to read the rules beforehand. To configure the rules channel, use m.config -captcha -rules <#channel> ! Waiting Channel Mila requires a Waiting Channel in order to require new members to use m.verify within, this channel is configured by using m.config -captcha -wait <#channel> . Member Role In order to work, Mila requires a configured role to give to members who successfully complete a captcha in order to give them access to the server.

The error handler built into the core makes sense of the error and calmly handles it, both in the terminal and in an error log. The core also tries to identify the error, if it is one that is quite common and can be expected to happen depending on a user's input, then it is not logged and is calmly returned to the user as a small embed. Throughout this guide you will see a demonstration of each and every common error that will generally happen due to user-based variables. Input Error An Input Error will happen when a user doesn't provide a required argument, or the argument is incorrect. For example if you use the m.ri command with a role that doesn't actually exist then an error will be shown. Furthermore if you don't provide a role at all then you will be prompted with an error too. Command On Cooldown Some commands have a small cooldown timer to prevent over-use, if a command is found to be on cooldown when it's invoked then you will be prompted to wait for a few seconds before trying again. Not every command is restricted by cooldowns, only the big ones that take a while to process. Missing Authorization A Missing Authorization error occurs when you are missing Mila's authorization to do something. This can be found when using the following without authorization: Moderation Commands Developer Commands Bot Staff Commands This error is probably the least common of the few common errors because dev commands aren't documented and mod commands aren't normally attempted when you know that you can't use them. NSFW Command Certain commands contain adult-only content and so, by jurisdiction of Discord Bot Guidelines, must only be usable in channels marked as NSFW. If you attempt to use one of said commands then you will be prompted to try again in an NSFW channel. Missing Permissions Sometimes you may attempt to perform a moderator action, however you get an error, this will probably be a Missing Permission error. This error occurs when Mila is missing the necessary permissions to perform certain actions, if she is then you will be prompted by Mila regarding the issue. When prompted, Mila will also tell you which permission is missing, this is useful if you plan to give Mila these permisssions.","title":"Common Errors"},{"location":"common-errors/#error-documentation","text":"","title":"Error Documentation"},{"location":"common-errors/#errors","text":"The Mila Core has to deal with a lot of errors that are randomly launched at it whenever something goes wrong.

Custom Prefix Mila has the ability to set a single custom prefix for every guild. This setting will replace the default prefix of m. with the prefix you choose. In case you and everyone else in the server forgets the prefix you set, you can always use @Mila#6910 instead. This setting can be changed with m.config -prefix <prefix> . Custom Greeting Mila has a setting that allows you to change the message displayed in user logs to whatever you want. To prevent spam the message can't be any longer than 300 characters, including spaces and non-ascii text. This setting has a series of dynamic variables, they are: {user} - Username & tag {user.mention} - Username mention {server} - Server name To change this setting, you must use m.config -greeting <message> . Custom Goodbye This setting is the same as greeting messages except it is displayed when a user leaves. To change this setting, you must use m.config -goodbye <message> . Config Resetting Resetting Mila's configuration is really simple, you can reset everything with m.config -reset . Automatic Setup If you're struggling with configuration, Mila has a useful command that will re-create the recommended configuration for you! This is done using m.config -autosetup and will take about 5 seconds to finish. Logging Module Mila has 4 logging systems built-into it, the three types of logging include: Message logging Mod logging User logging Action logging These can come in handy for people that like to keep a record of all the things that happen in their server. To change a logging channel, simply do m.config -logs -<log type> <channel> . Mod Logging Mila's mod logging can be controlled via m.config -logs -mod <channel> . Mod-logs are created every time a user is: Warned Kicked Muted Unmuted Banned Unbanned User Logging Mila's user logging can be controlled via m.config -logs -user <channel> . User-logs are created every time a user: Joins Leaves Message Logging Mila's message logging can be controlled via m.config -logs -msg <channel> . Message-logs are created every time a message is: Deleted Edited Action Logging Mila's action logging can be controlled via m.config -logs -action <channel> . Action-logs are created every time a channel, role or guild setting is: Created Deleted Edited Log Layout The team has come up with a recommended log layout that they suggest novice user's follow to keep everything simple for them. Role Management Mila has 5 different role management systems, each role assigned to each of the five systems plays a significant role in many of Mila's other systems, like moderation. Here is a list of all four different role options: Bot role Human role Muted role Moderator role Administrator role Roles can be controlled via m.config -roles -<role type> <@role> . Bot Role When given a specific role to assign, Mila will automatically give a bot account said role once it joins the server, it can be changed with m.config -roles -bot <@role> . Human Role When given a specific role to assign, Mila will automatically give a human account said role once it joins the server, it can be changed with m.config -roles -human <@role> . Muted Role Assigning a muted-role allows Mila to hand users this role when they are muted, typically this role should not have the ability to speak in general channels else it defeats the point of being muted. This role is controlled using m.config -roles -muted <@role> . If this role isn't configured when a mod attempts to mute a user, Mila attempts to find a role called Muted in your server and assign that instead. Moderator Role By assigning a Moderator role you are essentially assigning everyone with that role as a Moderator, thus allowing them to use most of Mila's moderation commands, however some are limited to Administrators and above. This role is controlled via m.config -roles -mod <@role> . When a user has the Moderator role, their perks are: Access to moderation commands without requiring specific permissions Bypasses the <Mila:NoCmd> setting Bypasses the auto-moderator functionality Administrator Role An Administrator role is something that should be chosen carefully, users with the Administrator role have the ability to change configurations and do just about anything with Mila. This role is assigned via m.config -roles -admin <@role> . Role Layout A recommended role layout has been designed by the Mila developers as it ensures that all roles work correctly, this doesn't mean that other roles can't be there, this is just a demonstration of the order of Mila's roles. Moderation Management Mila comes built in with some handy auto-moderation features these features essentially allow the bot to punish users if they do a certain thing. Violation Limit This setting allows you to control how many times a user can trigger auto-mod except for Anti-Hoist in 10 minutes. This value must be above 0 else Mila will send an error. If this limit is hit, Mila will preform the configured action. This setting is controlled using m.config -anti -violations <number> . Violation Action This setting allows you to control what action is performed on a user when they exceed the specified number of auto-mod violations, this can only be one of Ban, Kick & Mute. This setting is controlled using m.config -anti -action . Note Anti-invite sets a nickname for user's whose nickname contains an invite link. Anti-porn also sets a nickname for user's whose nickname contains a pornographic link. Anti Invite Enabling this will ensure that Mila deletes every Discord server invite that a non-staff user sends, regardless whether the invite is valid or not. Anti Porn Anti-porn removes pornographic links sent outside of channels marked as NSFW. This doesn't tend to get much use but for very large servers it can be necessary. Anti Hoist This setting automatically removes nicknames contain hoisting or Zalgo content, which is useful if your server's policy involves mentionable nicknames. Anti Spam Anti-spam is, without a doubt, one of the most essential auto-moderation settings out there. If a user sends 5 messages consecutively within a 5 second time frame, the messages are removed and the perpetrator is handed a warning from Mila.","title":"Configs"},{"location":"configs/#config-documentation","text":"","title":"Config Documentation"},{"location":"configs/#basic-settings","text":"Mila has a handful of basic configuration settings, currently they are: Custom Prefixes Custom Greeting Custom Goodbye These can be used for general purposes and aren't entirely necessary.","title":"Basic Settings"},{"location":"configs/#custom-prefix","text":"Mila has the ability to set a single custom prefix for every guild.
